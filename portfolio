Experience

As a student
I’ve lived in many regions, varying from the metropolis of Beijing and Shanghai, to rural areas in Hebei province. This gave me a wide understanding of China’s modernisation and some traditional customs. This also led to mastery of mandarin and several dialects in China in addition to effective communication skills with nationals and internationals alike.

As a designer
Designed “Leap Motion Controller”, developed it with my group “Finger Controls World” to control domestic devices.
Invented “Gesture Beat” by using Kinect, enabling our body the function of instruments.
Designed “3D Models and Virtual Reality Simulation of E. Coli Bacterial” as part of NYU Shanghai iGEM Project, which won the Silver medal of iGEM 2015.
